				<p>
					A custom commission may simply be an order to reproduce a piece 
					I have designed in the past, or one similar, but differing in dimensions or in choice of wood.  
					Because I make each piece one at a time, the cost for such a project is likely to be quite close to that of the original.

				</div>
				<p>
					<br>
					Other commissions are placed by clients who like the design and quality of my work, and would
					like me to create a new design to perfectly suit their needs in form and in function. 
					For these projects, the customer and I will work together to define the requirements of the piece:
					where it will go, how it will be used, the dimensions, aesthetics and price. 
					You can provide as much or as little direction as you desire. Unique commissions such as these are a particular pleasure for me!
